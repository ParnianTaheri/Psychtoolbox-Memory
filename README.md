In this homework, we are supposed to make a pschophysic task using psychtoolbox on Matlab. 

In this task, random number of images ([3, 5, 7, 9]) in each trial is shown to a monkey and if the monkey chooses the high-value image gets 3 point and if it chooses the low-value one gets 1 point.

There are 2 types of sessoins, TA and TP. In TA all the images are low-value, and if it chooses one of them gets 1 point but if does not choose any for 2 to 4 sessions it gets 1 point in the end.

I use keyboard for choosing images as below:

X: reject

Space: choose

ESC: return
